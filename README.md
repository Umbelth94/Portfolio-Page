# Portfolio Page

## Description
A portfolio project built from scratch to showcase some of my best projects.  The goal was to exercise what we have learned in the last few weeks regarding HTML and CSS to build a complete web portfolio.  There was a strong emphasis on flexbox, positioning elements via CSS, and page responsiveness to scaling with the window.  This was the first project that I have built starting with mobile usability in mind, so it was very challenging to try and style the page in an order I was not used to.  I tried to be as concise as I could with the CSS and avoid any redundancies.  That being said, I ended up building a webpage with kind of a hybrid setup for mobile and desktop, where extreme edge cases for sizing were given breakpoints but the main chunk of the CSS kind of falls right in the middle of mobile sizing and desktop sizing.  The end result is still responsive though and based on my testing, nothing clips or breaks and everything remains readable and accessible.

## Credits

The page was based around a mockup for the assignment, so my color scheme, layout, and stylings were based around that.  

For the background image, I used [This image](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/blue-paint-wall-background-texture_2791913.htm?query=texture%20background#from_view=detail_alsolike)

For the projects themselves, I created those on my self-taught journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

For the profile picture, I just used my face!  


## Future Goals
- Update this as I build more portfolio-worthy projects
- Add icons to the Contact links
